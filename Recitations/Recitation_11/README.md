# Problem Set 11 - Android

This is not really a problem set. It's actually a demo of an app that uses a `GridView` layout, with images in the cells. `ImageView` and `ImageAdapter` classes are used to lay out images, and have users click on them to launch an action.

This should be useful base line functionality for your Android project.

To import images into the `drawable` folder, see this at [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57330638) - should be a link to the "For Android Studio 3.4+" solution.
