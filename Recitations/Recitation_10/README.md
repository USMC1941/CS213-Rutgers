# Problem Set 10 - Android

Write an Android app that can accept an order to make a sub. Have checkboxes to select (or unselect) items to add (lettuce, tomato, etc.) Have combo boxes or equivalent to select one out of many (exclusive) options like the type of cheese to put in the sub. When the user confirms the order (via a button), display a message in a text area that lists the sub contents. Your UI doesn't have to be pretty - just make it work correctly.

This project is called `Sub`.
